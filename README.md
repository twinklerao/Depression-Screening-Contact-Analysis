# Depression-Screening-Contact-Analysis

## Project Summary: Depression Screening Analysis Using PHQ-9 Scores

In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information on 12 patients, to explore trends in depression screening (PHQ-9) scores. The dataset also included information on medication adherence, daily steps, and patient activation levels, offering a comprehensive view of patient engagement and health outcomes.

## Objective
The main goal of this analysis was to investigate whether the type of contact influenced depression screening outcomes, as measured by PHQ-9 scores. Understanding these relationships could inform more effective patient engagement strategies in clinical practice.


## Analysis

Average PHQ-9 Score by Contact Type: The average PHQ-9 scores were calculated for each contact type to identify any significant differences.

Trend Analysis: PHQ-9 score trends were analyzed for individual patients across different contact types, with visualizations created to depict these trends.

Impact of Contact Type: The impact of each contact type on PHQ-9 scores was examined, particularly focusing on whether certain types of contact led to consistently higher or lower scores.

## Key Findings

### Type of Contact Matters

#### Digital Contacts
Patients who engaged in digital interactions tended to have higher PHQ-9 scores, indicating potentially less effective intervention through this mode.

#### Group and In-Person Contacts
Group therapy and in-person clinic visits were associated with lower PHQ-9 scores, suggesting these methods may be more effective in reducing depression symptoms.

#### Phone and Home Visits
These contact types generally resulted in intermediate PHQ-9 scores.
